========================================
     ✓ SUCCESS! SERVERS ARE RUNNING
========================================

FIXED ISSUES:
✓ Maven PATH corrected
✓ Backend compiled successfully
✓ Backend server started on http://localhost:8080
✓ Frontend server started on http://localhost:3000

WHAT I DID:
-----------
1. Found Maven at: C:\Program Files\Apache\maven\apache-maven-3.9.11
2. Added correct path to system PATH: C:\Program Files\Apache\maven\apache-maven-3.9.11\bin
3. Built backend: mvn clean package -DskipTests
4. Started backend in separate PowerShell window
5. Started frontend in separate PowerShell window

TWO TERMINAL WINDOWS ARE NOW OPEN:
-----------------------------------
1. Backend Terminal - Running Spring Boot on port 8080
2. Frontend Terminal - Running React on port 3000

NEXT STEPS - TEST REGISTRATION:
================================

1. Open your browser to: http://localhost:3000

2. You should see the CampuSwap homepage

3. Click "REGISTER" button

4. Fill in the registration form:
   ✓ Email: test@example.com
   ✓ Password: password123
   ✓ Full Name: Test User
   ✓ Phone Number: 1234567890

5. Click "Register" button

6. If successful:
   - You'll be automatically logged in
   - You'll see the dashboard/home page
   - Token will be saved in browser

7. Try logging out and logging back in with same credentials

VERIFY BACKEND:
===============
Open: http://localhost:8080
You should see a "Whitelabel Error Page" - this is GOOD!
It means backend is running but you hit the root endpoint.

FEATURES TO TEST:
=================
After successful registration/login:
✓ Browse products
✓ Search products
✓ Add new product (with images)
✓ Add to wishlist
✓ View product details
✓ Make a transaction
✓ Send messages via chat
✓ Leave reviews
✓ Check notifications

ADMIN FEATURES:
===============
To create admin account:
1. Register a normal user first
2. Stop backend (Ctrl+C in backend terminal)
3. Open PostgreSQL and run:
   UPDATE users SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
4. Restart backend
5. Login - you'll have admin panel access

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
If registration still fails:
→ Check browser console (F12) for errors
→ Check backend terminal for error logs
→ Verify both terminals are running without errors
→ Try: http://localhost:8080 to confirm backend is up

If you close terminals:
→ Just double-click: C:\Users\VISHAL\CampuSwap\START-ALL.bat
→ Maven PATH is now fixed permanently!

DATABASE:
=========
Backend automatically created tables in PostgreSQL database: campuswap
You can view data using pgAdmin or any PostgreSQL client.

CONGRATULATIONS! 🎉
Your CampuSwap application is now fully operational!
