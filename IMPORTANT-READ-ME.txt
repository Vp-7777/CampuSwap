  CampuSwap - IMPORTANT SETUP NOTES
======================================

I've just launched START-ALL.bat which should open 2 terminal windows.

ISSUE DETECTED: Maven Path Configuration
-----------------------------------------
Your Maven path in environment variables is:
  C:\Users\VISHAL\Downloads\apache-maven-3.9.11-bin

But this directory doesn't exist or is incomplete.

SOLUTION - Fix Maven Path:
===========================

Option 1: If Maven is Already Installed
----------------------------------------
1. Find where Maven is actually installed
2. Look for a folder like: apache-maven-3.9.11 (not -bin)
3. Inside should be: bin, boot, conf, lib folders
4. Update your PATH to point to the "bin" folder
   Example: C:\Users\VISHAL\Downloads\apache-maven-3.9.11\bin

Option 2: Fresh Maven Install
------------------------------
1. Download Maven from: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
2. Extract the zip file (NOT to Downloads, use C:\Program Files or C:\Tools)
3. Add to PATH: [extract location]\apache-maven-3.9.11\bin
4. Verify: Open new CMD and type: mvn --version

HOW TO UPDATE PATH:
===================
1. Press Windows Key
2. Type "Environment Variables"
3. Click "Edit system environment variables"
4. Click "Environment Variables" button
5. Under "System variables", find "Path"
6. Click "Edit"
7. Fix the Maven path or add correct one
8. Click OK on all windows
9. RESTART any open terminals

AFTER FIXING MAVEN:
===================
1. Close any open terminal windows
2. Double-click: C:\Users\VISHAL\CampuSwap\START-ALL.bat
3. Wait for both servers to start
4. Open browser: http://localhost:3000

ALTERNATIVE - Use IntelliJ IDEA:
=================================
If Maven setup is difficult, you can:
1. Open the "backend" folder in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Let IntelliJ download Maven dependencies
3. Right-click CampuswapApplication.java → Run
4. For frontend: Open terminal in "frontend" folder and run: npm start

TESTING:
========
Once both servers are running:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click Register
3. Create account: test@example.com / password123 / Test User
4. Login with same credentials
5. Browse products, add items, test features
