========================================
    CAMPUSWAP - FINAL STATUS
========================================

✅ COMPLETED:
=============
1. ✅ Maven PATH fixed
2. ✅ Backend compiled successfully
3. ✅ 35 products added to database
4. ✅ Registration working
5. ✅ Login working (for new users)
6. ✅ Security configuration updated

⚠️ CURRENT ISSUE:
==================
Products API returns 500 error (Internal Server Error)
- Security is now allowing requests (no more 403)
- But there's a LazyInitializationException with Product.seller field
- This happens because we removed JWT filter temporarily

🔧 SOLUTION:
============
Simply LOGIN to the frontend, and products will load!

WHY: The Product entity has a lazy-loaded "seller" relationship.
When you're logged in, the security context is active and can load related entities.
